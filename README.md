## UE4_Minimap
Welcome to the UE4_Minimap wiki!

This is a sample project showing the MiniMap Widget for Unreal Engine 4. The widget uses only Textures and no SceneCapture2D, it's build completely in Blueprint.

### Currently, the widget futures:
- Map based on textures (Material).
- Dynamically adding POIs (Point of Interest) and removing them when out of range.
- Tracking POIs as they move.
- Zooming in and out.


### Features to come:
- Different markers per tag, so that different POIs can be shown with different colors or signs.
- Translate point on map to world location.
- Full size map.
- Pointer that points into direction of POIs which are outside of Minimap scope.
- Tutorial on how to use the widget.

Let me know if you would like to see more features.
